Playing a Card
[] When a face value of 0 is played, remove all cards from the Parade (except the 0 card itself) and add to player's collection
[] If the played card has a value v, then the first v cards in the Parade (from the right) are safe and cannot be removed
   --> The removal check starts from the (v+1)th card onward
[] Then, remove cards if the colour matches and value comparison
   --> Has the same colour as the played card
   --> Has a value equal to or lower than the played card

End Game Condition
[] Game proceed to final round when one of the following happens:
    --> No more cards can be drawn from the deck
    --> A player collects all 6 colours
[] Player discard 2 cards from their hand and add to their collection
[] Player with the lowest score wins
    --> If players have the same score, the winner will be decided based on 2 conditions:
         1. The player with the least collected cards, followed by
         2. The player with the least number of colors
