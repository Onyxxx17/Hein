 [] Then, remove cards if the colour matches and value comparison
    --> Has the same colour as the played card
    --> Has a value equal to or lower than the played card

     --> No more cards can be drawn from the deck
     --> A player collects all 6 colours
 [] Player discard 2 cards from their hand and add to their collection
